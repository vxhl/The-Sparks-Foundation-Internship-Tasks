_Please click on the images on right side to view my solution._

● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/2HxiGGJ

● Task submission:

1. Host the code on GitHub Repository (public). Record the code and
output in a video. Post the video on YouTube
2. Share links of code (GitHub) and video (YouTube) as a post on
YOUR LinkedIn profile, not TSF Network.
3. Submit the LinkedIn link in Task Submission Form when shared.
